# Announcing our New Preview Environment

We just rolled out **"enhancements"** and **"new functionality"** from our upcoming v1.24 release to our Preview environment. This release will be promoted to our "Production" environment in a few weeks. Learn more about our Preview Environment and about the enhancements and new functionality in the v1.24 release.

## What is the Preview Environment?

As part of our SDLC process, we have always had a Preview environment. As a practice, for every release, once the QA team has qualified a release, the Rafay Operations team promotes it to Preview for a few weeks for soak testing before pushing it out to Production.

This environment was previously not available to our customers. In conversations with our customers throughout last year and at our recent customer council meeting at the end of 2022, we heard that our customers would like to experience new functionality before it was available in their Production Orgs.

In response to this, we have invested in **"scaling up"** and **"hardening"** our internal only Preview environment. We are now ready to **"open this up"** to our customers. Going forward, functionality from every new release will be available in this Preview environment for the benefit of our customers for approximately 3-4 weeks before we roll this out to Production Orgs.

## Next Steps

All customers are **eligible for a free Org** in our Preview environment. We strongly recommended that customers work with Rafayâ€™s Customer Success team to request an Org in Rafay's Preview environment and try out the new features.
